* Story

** Introduction to Role Playing

   A basic introduction to RP mechanics will be helpful at the start. They will
   need to start getting used to things like basic dice rolling (for some simple
   skill checks) as well as getting used to their own characters.

*** Character Background Activity

    All of the characters will need to introduce themselves through some sort of
    (probably contrived) activity. The goal at this point won't necessarily be
    immersion, just getting all of our stories straight.

*** Basic NPC Interaction

    Once an NPC enters the mix, it will be a little more important that things
    be believeable. The group should start committing to RP while learning about
    skill checks.

** Introduction to Combat

   After introducing basic role playing, combat will be next. First, the group
   can observe a turn of combat between an NPC and an enemy, and then they will
   join in the fight.

*** Watch NPC in Combat

    This part will mostly be a "here's a quick look at what will happen" thing.

*** Join Combat (Nonthreatening)

    Once they have their bearings, the group will roll for initiative and join
    in the combat. This combat is *not* expected to be a resource drain; it is
    just to get players used to their spells and abilities.

** Quest: "A Relatively Annoying Problem"

   At this point, the party will be presented with a quest (which they will be
   expected to take). If they do not accept the quest, I will likely need to
   massively improvise. They'll probably take it though.
